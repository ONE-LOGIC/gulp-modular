# gulp-modular
Boilerplate gulp tasks for quick project setup.

# Setup
 1. Go to your project root
 2. `git submodule add https://github.com/ONE-LOGIC/gulp-modular/`
 3. Create `gulpfile.js` and `require()` tasks from `gulp-modular/tasks/` (cf. [graFiddle gulpfile.js](https://github.com/GraFiddle/grafiddle/blob/develop/gulpfile.js)). Optionally add composite tasks to the file.
 4. Create `gulp_config.js` and define globs and flags required by the gulp-modular tasks (cf. [graFiddle gulp_config.js](https://github.com/GraFiddle/grafiddle/blob/develop/gulp_config.js)).
